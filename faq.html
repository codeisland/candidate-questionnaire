<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>


<h3>What is Open Data?</h3>
<p>Most often, &lsquo;open data&rsquo; refers to the idea that data controlled by a government body should be accessible to citizens and other government bodies in a structured format. In an open structured format, computer programs can readily understand and process the data. For example, a <abbr title="Comma Seperated Value">CSV</abbr> is an open structured format, while a <abbr title="Portable Document Format">PDF</abbr> is not. Open data policies reduce cost and technology barriers, which limit citizens&rsquo; access to government data. The nonpartisan Sunlight Foundation publishes best practices for open data policies (<a href="http://sunlightfoundation.com/opendataguidelines/">http://sunlightfoundation.com/opendataguidelines/)</a>.</p>

<h3>What is an Open Standard?</h3>
<p>In the context of open data, an open standard typically refers to a data format whose specification is freely available to be read and implemented by anybody. Data available in an open standard is often the most accessible to analysts, journalists, and programmers, as anybody can access the tools and information needed to work with that data. Because of this, open standards often support competitive markets of applications and organizations that perform similar services on similar types of data.</p>

<h3>Do City reports provide access to city data?</h3>
<p>Not to the level that open data does. A report published by the city represents a finished presentation of data. The report includes analysis, formatting and layout, and commentary that is meant to be read by people, and often meant to be read by a certain audience. While these presentations of data are valuable, they usually do not provide the raw, structured data required by others who wish to create their own analyses, presentations, or new applications.</p>

<h3>Which cities officially support open data?</h3>
<p>The Sunlight Foundation (<a href="http://sunlightfoundation.com/policy/opendatamap/">http://sunlightfoundation.com/policy/opendatamap/</a>) maintains a list of open data policies. A report by the San Diego Data Bank - sandiegodata.org/reports/municipal-open-data- policies/ - recently analyzed the policies of 8 major US and Canadian cities that have implemented open data programs in the last seven years. These cities include Austin, Chicago, Philadelphia, Portland, New York, San Francisco, Washington, D.C. At the federal level, the White House has also implemented an open data policy for the executive branch.</p>
